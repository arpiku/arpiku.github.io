Here is the [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resume.pdf)!

Born in the vibrant and beautiful land of India, I always found the magic of a remote control car just as mysterious as the one in Harry Potter, growing up I have realised that the Harry Potter world was always considerably behind us. 

I truely enjoy the beauty of engineering and consistently find myself enthralled by the majestic nature of modern technology, further the fact that I just have the ability to go ahead and learn about all this magic is well .... magical! 

Software engineering is the field that I have been able to practice the most but I have dabbled in CAD modeling, CFD simulation, Electronics engineering(Have done a lot bad soldering jobs). My primary education was in Physics and I am lucky enough to have received it from one of the most prestigious institues in my nation, [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in).

I wish to be able to grow and polish my art of engineering and be able to employ it to provide value to my family and friends while being able to teach it to as many people I can.
